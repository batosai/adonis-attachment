# Introduction

The `adonis-attachment` package was designed to simplify file upload management. It allows you to create alternative files, called `variants`, with options for optimization, resizing, and format changes. Additionally, it automatically generates image thumbnails for document and video files.

The creation of variants is handled through Converters.
